    <h1>Accounting Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>
        Accounting is the process of recording, summarizing, analyzing, and reporting financial transactions of a
        business. It provides crucial information for decision-making. The two main types are financial accounting and
        managerial accounting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Accounting Equation</h2>

    <p>
        The fundamental accounting equation is the foundation of the double-entry bookkeeping system.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity</li>
        <li>This equation must always be in balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Financial Statements</h2>

    <p>
        There are three primary financial statements used to summarize a company's financial health.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows a company's financial position at a specific point in time.</li>
        <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Reports a company's financial performance over a period of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Statement of Cash Flows:</strong> Summarizes the cash generated and used by a company.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Simple Transaction Table</h2>

    <p>
        Here is a table showing a few basic accounting transactions.
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
